# Semi-Guided Insurance Data Viz Project

(**Note**: I consider this project "semi-guided" because parts of the analysis are my own, while other parts were provided via the Coursera and "code used in part 4" links referenced below.)

Objective: In this project, I analyze a dataset that contains information about insured individuals in the United States.
